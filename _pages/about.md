I have a master's in applied math from the University of Vermont, where I learned a lot about AI. Before grad school, I automated workload processes at Goldman Sachs, interned as a quantitative analyst at Zions Bancorporation, and worked on a statistical consulting project for eBay. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
* Cooking from scratch (stopping just short of creating the universe). Right now I'm all about fermentation, be that turning apples to vinegar, making ropy Finnish yogurt, or baking 100% whole wheat bread that passes the windowpane test.
* Cuddling my sweet kitties.
* Outdoors.
