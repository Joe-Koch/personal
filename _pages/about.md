Hey, I'm Joe. I'm a senior machine learning engineer based out of Salt Lake City, specializing in the ops, platforms, and infrastructure side of ML. My background's mostly in finance, including companies like Mastercard, Goldman Sachs, eBay, and Zions Bancorporation. Passionate about harnessing modern tools, I actively explore and advocate for technologies that not only enhance our work efficiency but also replace frustration with a sense of joy in our daily tasks. Culturally, I prioritize psychological safety, fostering an environment where the team feels empowered to take risks, share ideas, and seek feedback. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
* Hiking and biking in Utah's mountains 
* Reading a ridiculous number of audiobooks 
* Falling into deep dives and wikipedia holes researching whatever's interesting, from gender theory to anime soundtracks
